# Portfolio (generated from resume)


This is a simple one-page static portfolio scaffold built from your resume PDF located in this folder.

Files:
- `index.html` — the single-page portfolio
- `styles.css` — base styling
- `script.js` — small UX enhancements (smooth scroll, year)
- `Sandeep-Majji-FlowCV-Resume-20250929 (2).pdf` — your resume (already in this folder)

How to preview

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local server).
2. This site currently omits an embedded resume. If you'd like a resume link or download button added back, I can add one pointing to a PDF in this folder (rename it to `resume.pdf` for a simple link) or create a printable HTML resume page.

Recommended next steps

- Replace placeholder text in `index.html` with content from your resume: summary, roles, achievements and project details.
- Add profile photo and project screenshots into an `assets/` folder and reference them.
- Provide links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and email in the Contact section.
- If you want, I can:
  - extract text from your PDF and auto-populate the About/Experience sections
  - add project cards with screenshots and GitHub/live links
  - create a small deploy guide and GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages

If you'd like me to auto-populate content from the PDF, tell me to parse it and give permission to read it (or provide a text export). Otherwise, tell me what color scheme and projects to feature and I'll update the site.
